> **UPDATE:** We are in the process of rewriting this repo into three layers; [Retrospector-JavaFx](https://github.com/NonlinearFruit/Retrospector-JavaFx), [Retrospector-Core](https://github.com/NonlinearFruit/Retrospector-Core), and [Retrospector-Hsqldb](https://github.com/NonlinearFruit/Retrospector-Hsqldb). This will continute to be the main repo for [issues](https://github.com/NonlinearFruit/Retrospector/issues), [releases](https://github.com/NonlinearFruit/Retrospector/releases), and [documentation](https://github.com/NonlinearFruit/Retrospector/wiki). The update will be finished by July 20, 2019.

Maintain an active list of your personal reviews/ratings of media. In a nutshell, with Retrospector you create a *Media* by entering a title and creator. Then you review that media by entering a number (1-10). In a month or a year, when you are looking for a movie to watch with friends, you can have your friends pick from your top 10 movies.

There are a lot of practical use cases. Once you start using Retrospector, you will wonder how you lived without being able to answer questions like 'What was my average rating for Firefly?' or 'How many times have I seen *The Holy Grail*?'

Instructions on how to install Retrospector are [here](https://github.com/NonlinearFruit/Retrospector/wiki/Install). In short, you make sure you have Java (a recent version), download the `Retrospector.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/NonlinearFruit/Retrospector/releases/latest), unzip and run `Retrospector.jar`.
